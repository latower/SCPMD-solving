# Dataset descriptions

We have defined _spread of influence_ problems on communities extracted from a dataset of Facebook wall interactions from [Online Social Networks Research @ MPI-SWS](http://socialnetworks.mpi-sws.org/data-wosn2009.html)

For our _power grid reliability_ problems, we use state- and country-based connected components of high-voltage power grids extracted from [GridKit](https://zenodo.org/record/47317#.XUBJIFyZZhH).

We provide the examples used during the initial experiments in Section 7 of our paper, as well as the examples used for the configuration experiment in Section 9.

We have created [ProbLog](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/) input files out of these datasets. They contain the logic for the probability distributions and the queries for the set of interest. The ProbLog files for the initial experiments do not contain a threshold $k$ for the linear constraint on the cardinality of the solution. The ProbLog files for the configuration experiments have an extra line at the start of the file that indicates the $k$ used in the configuration experiments. For those experiments, we also provide graph files that can be used to compute values needed for some of the branching heuristics in our experiments.
