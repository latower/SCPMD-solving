/****************************************************************************************
 * The dynamic vtree search algorithms tries to be selective on which parts of a
 * vtree it applies itself to. For this, it tries to identify parts of the vtree that
 * were "unchanged" since the last search (iteration) and avoids these parts.
 *
 * The definition of "change" is heuristic and is based on three factors: the size of
 * sdd nodes normalized for the vtree node, in addition to the identity of its left and 
 * right children. If none of these have changed since the last search iteration, the 
 * vtree node is considered unchanged.
 *
 * To implement this strategy, once must maintain a "state" with each vtree node to keep
 * track of the previous size, left child, and right child. This is done using the
 * VtreeSearchState structure in the code below. The field vtree->fold is set to 1 iff
 * all the nodes in vtree are unchanged. 
 *
 * Note: a leaf vtree node is considered unchanged iff its variable is being used 
 * by some decomposition sdd node.
 *
 * The search algorithm implements two strategies based on the notion of change:
 *
 * 1. The algorithm will apply itself to the smallest subtree with a changed vtree node
 * 2. The algorithm will treat a subtree as a (virtual) leaf when all nodes in the
 *    vtree are unchanged
 *
 * The state of a vtree node is updated after each pass of the search algorithm.
